# "No Thanks" game desciption

Game Components:
- 33 cards with numbers from 3 to 35
- Playing chips

Number of Players: 3-7

Game Setup:
1. Choose 9 cards at random and remove them from the deck.
2. Shuffle the remaining 24 cards.
3. Each player starts with an equal number of chips (e.g. 11 chips if there are 3-5 players, 9 chips if there are 6 players and 7 chips if there are 7 players).
4. Players should keep chips hidden. All cards face down.

Game play:

The first player turns over the top card. He either:
- Takes the card: earn the player point according to the value of the card
- Decline and pass the card: pay 1 chip by placing the chip onto the card ("No thanks")

If he declines the card, the turn passes onto the next player and make the same decision on whether to decline or accept the card. The play proceeds in a clockwise circle until someone finally accepts and takes the card along with all of its accumulated chips. This same player would then turn over the next card, and make the decision on whether to take or decline it. Tha game repeats until there are no cards left on the deck.

Game End:

When the game finishes, each player calculates the final score by:
- adding up the value of all his single cards (e.g. card 4,6,8 would worth 4+6+8=18 points)
- adding up the value of the lowest card of each consecutive number sequence (e.g. only add 4 points if there is a sequence 4,5,6, only add 5 points if there is a sequence 5,6)
- Subtract the number of chips he has at the end of the game (chips worth -1 point each).

The player with the lowest number of points wins the game.
